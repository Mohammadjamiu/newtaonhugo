Been an engineering student is great but the nitty-gritty is rough. To
say, the two most abstractive electrical engineering course most
student do have problem with is <span>Circuit Analysis</span> and
<span>Electromagnetics.</span>

Wait, there is still more - telecommunications & networking concepts and productivity for engineering students
needs to be demystified and simplified also.

          <u>Circuit Analysis</u> is a little bit straight forward but for
          <u>Electromagnetics</u>, forget it. It's full of abstraction and it is
          the reason why we stood up to :
        </p>

        <p class="reason-one">
          Limit the use of big textbooks if what we are looking for can be
          learnt in no time.
        </p>
        <p class="reason-two">
          Limit the boring and abstractive courses by explaining stuff in a
          better way.
        </p>
        <p class="reason-three">
          Help engineering student to find a small cloud where they can get some
          of their problem sets solved.
        </p>
        <p class="reason-four">
          Go an extra mile to help engineering student on how to be productive and be unique.
        </p>

            Feel free to get in touch with us on any stuff that might look
            abstractive to you, cheers. We're waiting to hear from you.
